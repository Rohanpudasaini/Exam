**Answers to the Questions:**

1. **What do you mean by BRIS and RCC?**

   - **BRIS:** BRIS stands for Birth Registration Information System. It is an electronic system introduced in Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC), Bangladesh, for registering births electronically. It creates a citizen identity with basic information and incorporates this data into a population database. The system aims to streamline birth registration processes and provide a platform for data sharing with various public agencies.

   - **RCC:** RCC stands for Rajshahi City Corporation. It is one of the oldest municipalities in Bangladesh and the location where the electronic Birth Registration Information System (BRIS) was introduced on a pilot basis.

2. **Which languages does BRIS support?**

   BRIS primarily works in Bengali, the native language of Bangladesh. However, the system has the capability to generate certificates and reports in English as well.

3. **Who are the stakeholders of this case?**

   The stakeholders involved in this case include:

   - **Health Agency:** The Department of Health is a key stakeholder as it uses the BRIS data to ensure the immunization of all children. The system provides vaccination lists for health workers and immunization schedules for parents based on registration data.
   
   - **Statistics Agency:** The statistics agency of the government is another stakeholder. BRIS contributes to data collection and storage, potentially supporting various statistical analysis tasks.
   
   - **Local Government (RCC):** The Rajshahi City Corporation is where the BRIS pilot was introduced. It is a stakeholder in terms of implementing and managing the system within its jurisdiction.
   
   - **Government Agencies:** Various government agencies involved in immigration, elections, education, and other services are stakeholders due to the potential integration of birth registration data for their respective processes.
   
   - **Parents and Citizens:** Although not directly mentioned, parents and citizens who benefit from streamlined birth registration processes and improved services like immunization are also stakeholders.

4. **What are the cost benefits of this case?**

   The case study outlines several cost benefits resulting from the implementation of the Electronic Birth Registration Information System (BRIS):

   - **Reduction of Duplication and Redundancy:** BRIS eliminates duplication and redundancy by centralizing birth registration data storage. This streamlines data management and reduces the need for redundant data entry across various agencies.
   
   - **Automation of Tasks:** The system automates searching, sorting, processing, and reporting tasks associated with activities like immunization. This automation saves time and reduces the potential for human errors.
   
   - **Increased Efficiency:** BRIS significantly reduces the time taken for tasks such as immunization scheduling and reporting.
   
   - **Reduced Error Rates:** The combined use of ID numbers and barcoding system helps reduce error rates in data entry and retrieval.
   
   - **Increased Registration and Immunization Rates:** The introduction of BRIS has led to increased birth registration and immunization rates, indicating improved accessibility and efficiency of the processes.
   
   - **Low Development and Operational Costs:** The direct costs of developing the system were relatively low (less than US$20,000), and operational costs are also reasonable (around US$200 per month).

Overall, the implementation of BRIS has brought about efficiency improvements, reduced errors, increased rates of registration and immunization, and achieved these benefits at a reasonable cost.
