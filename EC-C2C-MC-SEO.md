1. **C2C Model:**

   C2C stands for "Consumer-to-Consumer." It's a business model in which individual consumers engage in transactions with other individual consumers. In the C2C model, individuals can buy and sell products or services directly to each other, often facilitated by online platforms or marketplaces. This model has gained significant traction with the growth of e-commerce and online classified platforms.

   C2C transactions can involve used goods, handmade crafts, vintage items, and various services. Online auction sites and classified platforms allow individuals to list items they want to sell and connect with potential buyers. The rise of social media platforms has also contributed to the C2C model, where individuals can sell items within their social networks.

2. **Malicious Code:**

   Malicious code, often referred to as "malware," is software intentionally designed to harm, exploit, or compromise computer systems, networks, and user data. Malicious code can take many forms, each with its own malicious intent:

   - **Viruses:** These attach themselves to legitimate files and spread when the infected file is executed. Viruses can corrupt, modify, or delete data.

   - **Worms:** Worms are standalone programs that replicate themselves and spread over networks without requiring user interaction. They can consume network resources and slow down systems.

   - **Trojan Horses:** These are deceptive programs that appear harmless but contain malicious code. Trojans often open a backdoor on a system, allowing unauthorized access.

   - **Ransomware:** Ransomware encrypts a victim's files or locks them out of their system. The attacker demands a ransom in exchange for restoring access or decrypting the files.

   - **Spyware:** Spyware collects user information without consent. It can track browsing habits, capture keystrokes, and steal sensitive data.

   - **Adware:** Adware displays unwanted advertisements, often in a way that generates revenue for the attacker.

   - **Rootkits:** Rootkits are designed to hide malware from detection by modifying operating system functions or exploiting vulnerabilities.

   Preventing and mitigating the impact of malicious code requires cybersecurity measures, including antivirus software, firewalls, regular software updates, secure browsing practices, and user awareness.

3. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):**

   Search Engine Optimization is a set of techniques and strategies aimed at improving a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). The goal of SEO is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to a website by making it more relevant and appealing to both users and search engines.

   SEO involves various practices, including:

   - **Keyword Research:** Identifying relevant keywords and phrases that users are likely to search for.
   - **On-Page Optimization:** Optimizing individual web pages by incorporating keywords, creating high-quality content, and ensuring proper HTML markup.
   - **Off-Page Optimization:** Building backlinks from reputable websites, social media sharing, and other external factors that signal a site's credibility.
   - **Technical SEO:** Ensuring proper website structure, fast loading times, mobile responsiveness, and search engine crawlability.
   - **User Experience (UX):** Creating a user-friendly and engaging website experience to keep visitors on the site.

   SEO helps websites rank higher in search results, leading to increased visibility and more organic traffic. However, SEO is a continuous process that requires monitoring, adaptation to search engine algorithms, and ongoing optimization efforts.
